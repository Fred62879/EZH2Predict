    As a type of B-cell cancer that is most commonly found in elderly people above age 70, Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) can be classified into three major types, ABC, GCB, and unclassified.

    As the mutation commonly found in GCB subtype DLBCL patients, EZH2 mutation was believed to promote cancer development. Therefore, it would be helpful if DLBCL patients can be predicted at an early stage whether they would develop EZH2 mutation such that specific treatment measures can be adapted timely.

    Typically, the mutation of a specific gene would almost always be the result of the over-expression of certain promoting gene pathways or down-regulation of inhibiting gene pathways. Therefore, one possibility to predict EZH2 mutation would be to idenfity such pathways and use them as a signature to evaluate whether a specific patients would be likely to end up with EZH2 mutation.

    However, conventional biological experiments where hundreds of candidate genes will be examined individually does not present as an efficient choice. 
    In more detail, we would perform machine learning over the expression data of 400+ candidate genes across 20,000+ patients. If the postulated pathways do exist, the classifier would be able to learn patterns characterizing such pathways. When gene expression data from novel patients are given, the classifier can then give predictions whether such pathways exist in the patient and thus whether or not EZH2 mutation would be developed.
